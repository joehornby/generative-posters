# Generative Posters
Using P5.js, I created a design system for a series of posters that explore animation and typography.
Originally built in Processing, I am gradually porting a few of the posters to P5.js for online presentation.

## Live demo
An example poster can be viewed [here](https://joehornby.github.io/generative-posters/p5js/02/).
